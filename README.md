# Iris-Species-Prediction-Web-App
Built a full-stack web app that deploys a machine learning model trained on the Iris dataset. Users input sepal and petal measurements to instantly predict the flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica), showcasing end-to-end ML model training, deployment, and web integration.
